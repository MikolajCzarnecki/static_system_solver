Solve conical problem.
For each cone approximation 
    check if inner and outer solution match.
        If they match then done.
        If not then list tangents that are 'active'.
            Take a guess at the correct solution = inner+outer / 2.
            
            For inner polytope:
                remove face formed by active points.
                add faces formed by all but one active point and solution guess.
                
            For outer polytope:
                add new face formed by solution guess.
